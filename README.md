# NordlysetsElskerinde

This repo contains a python API (which has methods for all of my other projects as well). In this program, it runs on my pc and serves images to an Angular application which also runs on my pc. The application is very simple so far: it just displays a random picture from a folder. The photos are all of my family. The webpage is picked up by my Raspberry Pi powered Magic Mirror, on which there is a script to tune the browser Chromium to my angular app on boot. Attached is a picture of the final product at this point in time. My roommate and I can add images to the folder from our cellphones, and they are then instantly added to the rotation.
